**`POST`** `https://api.reflect-server.net/v1/apps/{app-id}/rooms/{uri-encoded-room-id}:create`

## Close room

Closing a room prevents it from accepting new connections from users, but leaves
existing connections unchanged. A call to [invalidate room connections](connections#invalidate-room-connections)
should be used to close existing connections.

A closed room is never re-opened and its `roomID` can never be re-used.
Closing a room, however, does not delete its data. Use the
[delete room](#delete-room) call to delete room data.

### Request

**`POST`** `https://api.reflect-server.net/v1/apps/{app-id}/rooms/{uri-encoded-room-id}:close`

### Response

```typescript
type CloseRoomResult = {};
```

Full response type: [`SuccessResponse<CloseRoomResult>`](overview#responses)

## Delete room

Deleting a room deletes all of its data. The condition is permanent.
In order to be deleted, a room must first beÂ [closed](#close-room). It should also
have had its users logged out via [invalidate room connections](connections#invalidate-room-connections).
