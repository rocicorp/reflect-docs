# Quickstart

## Scaffold

Creates a Vite/React/Reflect starter app.

```bash copy
npx @rocicorp/reflect create my-app
cd my-app
npm install
```

## Develop

Runs a fully local development environment for fast iteration.

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

## Publish

Deploys the Reflect server to [reflect.net](https://reflect.net/) and the UI to Vercel.

```bash copy
npm run publish
```

Monitor production logs:

```bash copy
npx reflect tail
```

## Quick Code Tour

- Change Reflect data by using _mutators_. Mutators are defined in `reflect/mutators.ts` and called via `reflect.mutate.foo()` in the UI.
- Mutators run on the client optimistically, and then later on the server. Despite mutators being `async` they almost always complete in one frame.
- Render data reactively using `useSubscribe()` in React or `reflect.subscribe()` in other frameworks.
