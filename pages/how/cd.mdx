# Continuous Deployment

If you host your application with a service like Netlify or Vercel, you can publish a separate Reflect app for each branch/preview. Changes to data or mutators in one branch won't affect other branches or production.

<Callout type="info">
These instructions work for Netlify and Vercel. If you use a different approach for continuous deployment, you can use them as a guide but the details will be different.
</Callout>

## Setup

<Steps>

### Generate a Reflect API Key

```bash copy
npx reflect keys create my-vercel-api-key
```

For Permissions select `app:publish` and for Authorized Apps select `(created apps)`.

### Create Environment Variables

In your hosting service, create two new environment variables:

1. `REFLECT_AUTH_KEY` with the value of the key you generated above.
2. `REFLECT_APP_NAME` with the value of the name of your Reflect app.

How to do this depends on your service. In Vercel, go to **Settings → Environment Variables**. In Netlify, go to **Site Configuration → General → Environment Variables**. Other hosting providers will have similar options.

### Add `publish-reflect.js` to your Project

Add the following file to your project. This script publishes a Reflect app with a name derived from the current branch name, then creates (or appends to) an `.env` file an environment variable with the URL of the published Reflect app.

```js copy filename="publish-reflect.js"
const { spawn } = require("child_process");
const fs = require("fs");
const { text } = require("stream/consumers");

const appBaseName = requireEnv({
  REFLECT_APP_NAME: process.env.REFLECT_APP_NAME,
});
const refName = requireEnv({
  HEAD: process.env.HEAD,
  VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF: process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF,
});

// Reflect app names have to start with a lower-case letter and can only
// contain lower-case letters, numbers, and hyphens.
const appName = `${appBaseName}-${refName}`
  .toLowerCase()
  .replace(/^[^a-z]/, "")
  .replace(/[^a-z0-9-]/g, "-");

publish();

async function publish() {
  const output = await runCommand("npx", [
    "reflect",
    "publish",
    "--reflect-channel=canary",
    `--app=${appName}`,
    "--auth-key-from-env=REFLECT_AUTH_KEY",
  ]);

  // Ick. A future version of Reflect will add an --output=json to avoid this.
  const lines = output.toString().split("\n");
  const success = lines.findIndex((line) =>
    line.includes("🎁 Published successfully to:")
  );
  const url = lines[success + 1];

  fs.writeFileSync("./.env", `NEXT_PUBLIC_REFLECT_SERVER=${url}`);
}

// Run a command and return its output, but also echo that output to the console.
function runCommand(command, args) {
  console.log("running command: " + command + " " + args.join(" "));

  const child = spawn(command, args, { stdio: [null, "pipe", "inherit"] });
  child.stdout.pipe(process.stdout);

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const output = text(child.stdout);
    child.on("close", (code) => {
      if (code !== 0) {
        reject(new Error(`Command failed with exit code ${code}`));
      } else {
        resolve(output);
      }
    });
  });
}

function requireEnv(kv) {
  const ret = Object.values(kv).find((v) => v);
  if (!ret) {
    throw new Error(
      `Required environment variable not found. One of [${Object.keys(
        kv
      )}] must be set.`
    );
  }
  return ret;
}
```

<Callout>
**Note:** `publish-reflect.js` writes the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_REFLECT_SERVER`. If you use a different framework than Next.js you will have to write the correct environment variable for that framework. For example, for Vite it would be `VITE_REFLECT_SERVER`.
</Callout>

### Call `publish-reflect.js` before Building

In your hosting service, modify your app's build settings to invoke `publish-reflect.js` before building your app:

<p style={{margin:'1em 0', border:'1px solid #ddd'}}><img src="/cd-build-settings.png"/></p>

How to do this depends on your service. In Vercel, within your project, go to **Settings → General → Build & Development Settings → Build Command**. In Netlify, go to **Site Configuration → General → Build & Deploy → Build Settings → Build command**. Other hosting providers will have similar options.

### Use Generated Environment Variable

Update your app to use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_REFLECT_SERVER` environment variable, or whatever environment variable you chose:

```ts copy
const r = new Reflect<M>({
  server: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_REFLECT_SERVER!,
  // ...
});
```

</Steps>

## Examples

Most of our example apps run on Vercel and use continuous deployment. You can look at them for more examples of how to integrate:

- [Draw](https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-draw/blob/main/publish-reflect.js) uses Next.js on Vercel.
- [Todo](https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-todo/blob/main/publish-reflect.js) uses Vite/React on Vercel.
- [Loop](https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-loop/blob/main/publish-reflect.js) is a more interesting Next.js/Vercel project that uses multiple Reflect apps which all have to be published together.
