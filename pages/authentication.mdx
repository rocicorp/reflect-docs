# Authentication

Reflect can optionally authenticate users who connect to rooms with your server. You can control which users can connect to which rooms.

1. Pass some `authToken` to the `Reflect` constructor's `auth` parameter.
2. Return an `authHandler` in the server's `makeOptions` function that authenticates the user and returns whether the user should be allowed in the room.

The signature for the auth handler is as follows:

```ts
/**
 * An `AuthHandler` should validate that the user authenticated by `auth` is
 * authorized to access the room with `roomID`.
 * @return A promise which resolves to `UserData` for the user if authentication
 * and authorization is successful, or rejects if authentication or
 * authorization fail.
 */
export type AuthHandler = (auth: string, roomID: string) => Promise<UserData>;

/**
 * `UserData` must include a `userID` which is unique stable identifier
 * for the user.
 * `UserData` has a size limit of 6 KB.
 * Currently only `userID` is used, but in the future `UserData` may
 * be passed through to mutators which could use it to supplement
 * mutator args and to validate the mutation.
 */
export type UserData = ReadonlyJSONObject & { userID: string };
```
