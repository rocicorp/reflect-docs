# Mutators

Mutators are how you make changes to data in Reflect. A mutator is a JavaScript function with a special signature:

```ts
import { WriteTransaction } from "@rocicorp/reflect";

async function myMutator(tx: WriteTransaction, arg: JSONValue) {
  // ...
}
```

By convention, mutators are defined in a file called `mutators.ts`. Here's an example containing two mutators:

```ts filename="mutators.ts"
export const mutators = {
  setHighScore,
  appendTodo,
};

async function setHighScore(tx: WriteTransaction, score: number) {
  const prev = (await tx.get<number>("highScore")) ?? 0;
  const next = Math.max(prev, score);
  await tx.set("highScore", score);
}

async function appendTodo(tx: WriteTransaction, item: string) {
  const prev = (await tx.get<string[]>("todos")) ?? [];
  const next = [...prev, item];
  await tx.set(key, next);
}
```

The `tx` parameter provides access to the room data. The `arg` parameter is any JSON-compatible value, and is data passed to the mutator by the application.

<Callout type="info">
  Mutators are fast. Despite being `async`, mutators almost always complete
  synchronously, triggering UI updates in the same frame. Mutators are `async`
  because when client-side persistence is enabled, they can ocassionally take
  longer than one frame. But even then, mutations should be fast enough that
  progress UI is not needed.
</Callout>

## Registering Mutators

To tell Reflect about your mutators, pass them to the client:

```ts
import { mutators } from "./mutators";

const r = new Reflect({
  roomID: "myRoom",
  mutators,
});
```

You can then invoke them like so:

```ts
r.mutate.setHighScore(4200);
```

Mutators are typesafe. You will get compile errors if you try and pass data incompatible with their declared arguments.

## Server-Side Registration

You must also make your mutators available to the server. To do this, register them in the server entrypoint, which is conventionally `/reflect/index.ts`:

```ts filename="/reflect/index.ts"
import { mutators } from "../src/mutators";

export default function makeOptions() {
  return {
    mutators,
  };
}
```

## How Mutators Work

The key idea in Reflect is that mutators actually run twice:

1. When the application calls a mutator, it runs immediately and updates the UI without waiting for a response from the server. We call these mutations _optimistic_.
1. A few moments later, during sync, the mutator runs again on the server against the _server's_ latest state. We call these mutations _authoritative_. They record the final result for a mutation that all clients will see.

<Callout type="info">
  The authoritative mutation can compute a different result than the optimistic
  mutation. This is a feature. The server might have newer or different
  information than the client. Reflect automatically rolls back optimistic
  results on the clients, and replaces them with authoritative results as soon
  as they are known.
</Callout>

By re-running mutators on the server, we provide the application the ability to
run any custom validation, authorization, merge, or other business logic it wants as part of sync.

This is far more flexible than typical multiplayer systems,
which expose only a few built-in datatypes and operations with no way to
extend or customize them.
