# Scaffold a New Reflect Project

Follow these instructions to create a simple Reflect starter app based on Vite and React. It takes about 15 seconds (depending on how peppy npm is feeling today).

  frameworks.

<Steps>

### Install

```bash copy
npx @rocicorp/reflect@latest create my-app
```

### Join Discord

[Join the Reflect Discord](https://discord.reflect.net/) so you'll be able to ask questions and get help.

### Develop

Reflect has a fully local development server (`npx reflect dev`) for fast iteration.

The `watch` script inside this starter app runs both the Reflect dev server and the Vite UI server (`npx vite`) in parallel for convenience:

```bash copy
cd my-app
npm run watch
```

Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in two tabs to see it in action.

### Publish

When you are happy with your app, publish the Reflect server to [reflect.net](https://reflect.net/):

```bash copy
npx reflect publish
```

This writes a local `.env` file containing the URL of the live server, so once it's done you can run against prodution with just:

```bash copy
npx vite
```

Watch the logs from production with:

```bash copy
npx reflect tail --room='my-room'
```

You can host the app UI just about anywhere since it's just static JS. For example, to use Vercel:

```bash copy
npx vercel
```
