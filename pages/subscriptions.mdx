# Subscriptions

Use the `subscribe` method of Reflect to watch for changes to data in the room:

```ts
r.subscribe(
  (tx) => tx.get("counter"),
  (value) => {
    myElm.textContent = value;
  },
);
```

## Queries

The function that is passed to `subscribe` is called a _query_. Queries can do multiple reads from Reflect and return any JSON-compatible value.

For example to subscribe to all incomplete todos:

```ts
r.subscribe(
  async (tx) => {
    const todos = await tx.scan({ prefix: `/todo/` }).toArray();
    return todos.filter((t) => !t.complete);
  },
  (todos) => {
    // render todos
  },
);
```

<Callout type="info">
  Subscriptions are fast. Queries are only re-run when data they depend on
  changes. And the subscription doesn't fire its callback unless the value
  returned from the query changes, reducing re-renders.
</Callout>

## React

In React, you can also use the `useSubscribe` hook from [`replicache-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/replicache-react):

```ts
import { useSubscribe } from "replicache-react";

const numTodos = useSubscribe(async (tx) => {
  const todos = await tx.scan({ prefix: "/todo/" }).keys().toArray();
  return todos.length;
});
```
