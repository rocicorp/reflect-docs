# Presence

Reflect keeps track of the clients currently connected to a room. You can use
this to show users who else is connected at any point in time, or to implement
features like cursors or selection state which should only be visible when the
associated client is connected.

Use the `subscribeToPresence` method of Reflect to watch for changes to the set of clients connected to the room:

```ts
r.subscribeToPresence((presentClientIDs) => {
  myElm.textContent = `Active Users: ${presentClientIDs.length}`;
});
```

<Callout type="info">
  When a client is offline, it will only see itself as being present.
  `presentClientIDs` will always contain the client's own client ID.
</Callout>

## Presence State

The `subscribeToPresence` method only tells you the client IDs of the clients that are present.
To do something useful with them, you will combine these client IDs with additional synced data about clients.
This additional client data is custom to your application. It is read and written
like any other Reflect data and can be [modeled using the Rails helper library](./model).

For example you might model your client data like so:

```ts
import { generatePresence } from "@rocicorp/rails";

type Client = {
  clientID: string;
  id: string;
  name: string;
  cursor: { x: number; y: number };
};

export const {
  set: setClient,
  get: getClient,
  init: initClient,
  update: updateClient,
  list: listClients,
} = generatePresence<Client>("client");
```

You can then filter this client data to just render the currently connected clients:

```ts
let presentClientIDs: readonly ClientID[] = [];
r.subscribeToPresence((clientIDs) => {
  presentClientIDs = clientIDs;
});

let clients: Record<ClientID, Client> = {};
r.subscribe(
  async (tx) => {
    const result: Record<ClientID, Client> = {};
    for (const client of await listClients(tx)) {
      result[client.clientID] = client;
    }
    return result;
  },
  (result) => {
    clients = result;
    render();
  },
);

function render() {
  for (const presentClientID of presentClientIDs) {
    const presentClient = clients[presentClientID];
    if (presentClient) {
      renderCursor(presentClient);
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  The reason to use `generatePresence` over the normal `generate` method is that
  the state will be removed by the Reflect server when it knows the client is
  never going to connect again.
</Callout>

## React

In React you can use the `usePresence` hook in combination with the `useSubscribe` hook.

```ts
import { usePresence, useSubscribe } from "@rocicorp/reflect/react";

const presentClientIDs = usePresence(r);
const presentClients = useSubscribe(r,
  async (tx) => {
    const result = [];
    for (const clientID of presentClientIDs) {
      const presentClient = await getClient(tx, {clientID});
      if (presentClient) {
        result.push(presentClient);
      }
    }
    return result;
  },
  [],
  [presentClientIDs]
);

return (
  <div>
    {presentClients.map(presentClient => (
      <Cursor
        key={presentClient.id}
        name={presentClient.name}
        cursor={presentClient.cursor}
        ></Cursor>
    ))}
  </div>
);
```
