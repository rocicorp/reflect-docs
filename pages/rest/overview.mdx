# REST API

Reflect's REST API empowers you to build automations and
integrate Reflect with your existing backend systems.

## Base URL

```http copy
https://api.reflect-server.net/
```

## Authorization

<Steps>

### Generate an API key

```bash copy
npx reflect keys create my-api-key
```

Each key is associated with a set of fine-grained permissions that authorize it
for API endpoints. The documentation for each endpoint indicates its required permission.

Run `npx reflect keys --help` for details on how to manage keys, including changing their
permissions and deleting (revoking) them.

### Set the `Authorization` Header

Pass the value of the key in the `Authorization` header of the request:

```http copy
Authorization: Basic {key-value}
```

</Steps>

## Requests

<Callout type="warning">
  Request parsing is strict. Unless included in the command specification, query
  strings and request bodies must be empty / unset.
</Callout>

## Responses

<Callout type="warning">
  Clients must be tolerant of unspecified fields in responses.
</Callout>

### 200

Success responses use the following JSON response body format:

```typescript copy
type SuccessResponse<T> = {
  result: T;
};
```

Consult the documentation for each endpoint for the result type `T`.

### 4xx

`4xx` errors arise from problems with the request and/or the state of the system.

The returned JSON response body provides details about the error:

```typescript copy
type ErrorResponse = {
  error: {
    /** The HTTP status code */
    code: number;
    /** The resource to which the error is relevant */
    resource: 'request' | 'rooms' | 'connections' | ...;
    /** A human-readable message */
    message: string;
  }
}
```

### 5xx

`5xx` server errors have no defined body format.

Clients may use exponential backoff to retry server errors, with a recommended
minimum of 1 second delay and maximum of 5 retries.
