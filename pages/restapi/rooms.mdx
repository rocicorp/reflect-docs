## Close room

A room isÂ closedÂ if it should no longer accept connections from users.
A closed room is never re-opened and itsÂ `roomID`Â can never be re-used.
Closing a room does not delete its data. Closing a room only prevents users from
connecting to the room, it does not log out users who may currently be connected.
A call to close the room should likely be followed by a call to
[invalidate room connections](connections#invalidate-room-connections),
which logs users out.

**`POST`** `https://api.reflect-server.net/v1/apps/{app-id}/rooms/{uri-encoded-room-id}:close`

JSON Body:

```typescript
{
  jurisdiction: "" | "eu";
}
```

### Response

```typescript
type CloseRoomResult = {};
```

Full response type: [`SuccessResponse<CloseRoomResult>`](overview#responses)

## Delete room

A room isÂ deletedÂ if it no longer accepts connections from users and all its data has been deleted.
This condition is permanent. TheÂ `roomID`Â will not be re-usable. In order to be deleted, a room must
first beÂ [closed](#close-room). It should also have had its users logged out via
[invalidate room connections](connections#invalidate-room-connections).
